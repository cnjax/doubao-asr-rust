# doubao-asr-rust

Unofficial asynchronous Rust SDK, CLI, and OpenAI-compatible HTTP server for
Doubao IME speech recognition.

The provider endpoints are undocumented and may change without notice. Use the
official Volcengine APIs for production workloads that require a supported
service contract.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.86 or newer
- `ffmpeg` in `PATH`, built with the `libopus` encoder
- Network access to the Doubao device registration and ASR endpoints

## Build and test

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test --all-targets
```

## Docker

Prebuilt `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images are published to GitHub
Container Registry:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  -e DOUBAO_ASR_API_KEY=change-me \
  -v doubao-asr-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/6kmfi6hp/doubao-asr-rust:latest
```

The image runs as UID/GID `10001`, stores credentials at
`/data/asr_credentials.json`, and includes FFmpeg with the `libopus` encoder.
The server listens on all container interfaces, while the example publishes it
only on the host loopback interface.

For the hardened Compose configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set DOUBAO_ASR_API_KEY in .env when clients require authentication.
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz
```

Compose uses a read-only root filesystem, a bounded temporary filesystem for
audio processing, drops Linux capabilities, and persists credentials in the
`doubao-asr-data` volume. Upgrade without discarding the credentials:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

To build the same image locally:

```bash
docker build --build-arg VERSION=dev -t doubao-asr:dev .
```

## CLI

Transcribe the first audio stream in a local audio or video file:

```bash
./target/release/doubao-asr recording.wav
./target/release/doubao-asr --json --output transcript.json recording.mp3
```

The first successful request anonymously registers a Doubao IME device and
stores its credentials in the OS user configuration directory. Credentials are
written atomically with owner-only permissions on Unix. Provider session
rejections first trigger a same-device token refresh and retry. Only a token
that is still rejected causes one device re-registration, so a stale token can
recover without deleting the credential file manually.

Run `doubao-asr --help` for all CLI options.

## OpenAI-compatible server

Start the server:

```bash
./target/release/doubao-asr-server
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:8000` by default and exposes:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `GET /v1/models/doubao-asr`
- `GET /healthz`

Only speech-to-text requests are supported. A request must contain exactly one
audio part. Text parts are accepted for client compatibility but are not sent
to the Doubao provider.

### OpenAI `input_audio`

`input_audio` accepts base64-encoded WAV or MP3 data:

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1", api_key="unused")

with open("recording.wav", "rb") as audio_file:
    audio = base64.b64encode(audio_file.read()).decode("ascii")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="doubao-asr",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "input_audio",
                    "input_audio": {"data": audio, "format": "wav"},
                }
            ],
        }
    ],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### vLLM/Qwen `audio_url`

`audio_url` accepts public or private HTTP(S) URLs and base64 data URLs:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "doubao-asr",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [{
        "type": "audio_url",
        "audio_url": {"url": "https://example.com/recording.wav"}
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

Local file URLs such as `file:///tmp/recording.wav` are rejected. Encode local
files with `input_audio` or serve them over HTTP(S).

### Delayed streaming

Requests with `"stream": true` receive valid Chat Completions SSE chunks ending
in `data: [DONE]`. Doubao recognition still completes before the first chunk is
sent; this is protocol compatibility, not real-time transcription.

## Server configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_LISTEN` | `127.0.0.1:8000` | Listen address |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_API_KEY` | unset | Optional Bearer API key |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_CREDENTIALS` | OS config path | Credential file |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_MODEL` | `doubao-asr` | Advertised and accepted model ID |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_UPLOAD_SPEED` | `1` | Upload pacing, greater than 0 and at most 4 |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Simultaneous requests |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `1800` | End-to-end request timeout |
| `DOUBAO_ASR_CREDENTIAL_REFRESH_SECS` | `21600` | Proactive same-device token refresh interval; `0` disables it |

Equivalent command-line flags are available from:

```bash
doubao-asr-server --help
```

When `DOUBAO_ASR_API_KEY` is set, all `/v1/*` requests require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

`/healthz` remains unauthenticated.

The observed anonymous settings response does not include a token expiry or
TTL. The server therefore refreshes the token every six hours by default while
reusing the existing device identity. It checks once per minute, retains the
current credential after refresh failures, and retries maintenance after 1, 5,
15, then 60 minutes. Provider session rejection remains an immediate fallback
even when proactive refresh is disabled.

## Limits and security

- Decoded audio is limited to 25 MiB; JSON requests are limited to 36 MiB.
- Remote downloads time out after 30 seconds and follow at most five redirects.
- When concurrency is exhausted, the server returns an OpenAI-style HTTP 429.
- Temporary audio files are deleted when each request completes or is cancelled.
- Logs exclude API keys, provider tokens, audio URLs, request bodies, transcripts,
  and audio data.

Remote `audio_url` requests are intentionally allowed to reach localhost,
private networks, link-local addresses, and other HTTP(S) destinations. This is
an SSRF capability. Do not bind the server to a public interface without a
strong `DOUBAO_ASR_API_KEY` and appropriate reverse-proxy or firewall controls.

## Releases

Releases are prepared automatically from Conventional Commit messages. A
`fix:` commit requests a patch release, `feat:` requests a minor release, and a
breaking change requests a major release. Release Please opens or updates a
Release PR; merging that PR creates the GitHub Release and publishes:

- GHCR tags `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, and `latest` for amd64 and arm64
- static musl CLI and server archives for Linux x86_64 and aarch64
- CLI and server archives for macOS 11+ x86_64 and aarch64
- `SHA256SUMS`, an image SBOM, and build provenance attestations

Downloaded binaries still require FFmpeg with `libopus` installed on the host.
The release workflow can also be run manually. Supply an existing `vX.Y.Z` tag
in `release_tag` to rebuild and re-upload that release's assets if publication
was interrupted, or leave `release_tag` empty to build the four platform
archives from the current branch and download them from the run's artifacts
without creating or modifying a release.

## Rust SDK

```rust,no_run
use doubao_asr::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> doubao_asr::Result<()> {
    let client = Client::new()?;
    let transcript = client.transcribe_file("recording.wav").await?;
    println!("{}", transcript.text);
    Ok(())
}
```
